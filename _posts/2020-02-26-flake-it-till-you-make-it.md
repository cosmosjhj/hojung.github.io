One line summary : This paper enhances DFT calculation by proposing novel architecture with refined loss that considers eigenvalues of the Kohn-Sham equations.

**1. Density Functional Theory (DFT) and its preliminaries**

**2. Method: Wave function alignment loss / Wavenet**

**3. Experiments**

**4. Discussion with personal viewpoint**

**5. Conclusion**
